### Cart related

    -   Ability to add/remove products and change their amounts in cart - on the cart page itself, PLP and PDP should be provided.
    -   For products that have various options (attributes) - the options should be selected.
    -   The selected options of added to cart products should be visible in cart overlay and in cart page.
    -   If an attribute is a swatch attribute (type = swatch), a representation of the value should be rendered on PDP and PLP, rather than text description (e.g. the color itself, not "Blue" or "0000FF")

### Page related

    -   The descriptions provided in HTML format should be parsed and presented as HTML, not as plain text
    -   Ability to change the currency of the store to one of the available currencies
